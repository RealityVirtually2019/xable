Closing the XR Divide 

There are 650 million people, 10% of the world's population, with some form of disability. Imagine if you were one of them, with a hearing or vision impairment or limited motor skills trying to engage in an XR experience? What if you were among the 8% of men who have some form of color blindness and could not distinguish colors in the XR space or to use controls? 

We're exploring ways to close the growing accessibility divide within XR by visualizing an open-source toolkit for developers that helps them integrate support for users with disabilities. Our theory of action is that taking a cross-platform compliance approach,developers will be more inclined to include accessibility support when creating new XR experiences. Based on the W3C/WAI 4 principles (perceivable, operable, understandable,and robust) we believe that the US ADA 508 compliance guidelines for web/mobile set a powerful precedent that should be extended to XR.

We're keenly aware that there are frequently recurring accessibility issues that may be commn to mulitple platorms. If we beign with the most common challenges then a new XR accessibility baseline could be established . From there, the possibilities are endless. we've brainstormed about these options as well. 

Here are a few examples of accessibility challenges and possible responses: 

CHALLENGE                                                               COMPLIANCE 

Color-blind user can't distinguish red-green or blue-yellow spectrums   The icon colors go into a high contrast mode or pattern overlay                                                                           helps to distinguish

Vision-impared user may ahve difficulty reading labels, navigating      Function enabled to allow user to enlarge elements when selected in 3D space
