Accessible UI/UX for XR

There are 650 million people wrldwide with some form of disability. We're exploring ways to close the growing accessibility divide within XR by visualizing a open-source toolkit for developers that helps them integrate support with cross-platform compliance to support users with disabilities 

One example would be for a colorblind individual to have the icon colors go into a high contrast mode.
Another example is for a user with low vision that would enable them to enlarge elements when selected.
