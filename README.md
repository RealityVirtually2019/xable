INTRODUCTION 
(why this project? why now? why this team/why we care?)
 
This team is keenly aware that as XR infiltrates our personal, business, social, and educational lives, there is a swath of the population worldwide that are being left behind, just as they were when web/mobile solutions were first being introduced- before ADA 508 compliance started getting government and commercial entities to pay attention to the needs of the disabled.  

Team Background & Motivations

PROBLEM
inclusivity issues encountered in XR; compelling data on how many impacted
There are 650 million people, 10% of the world's population, with some form of disability. Imagine if you were one of them, with a hearing or vision impairment or limited motor skills trying to engage in an XR experience? What if you were among the 8% of men who have some form of color blindness and could not distinguish colors in the XR space or to use controls? 

We're exploring ways to close the growing accessibility divide within XR by visualizing an open-source toolkit for developers that helps them integrate support for users with disabilities. Our theory of action is that by taking a cross-platform compliance approach to resolving accesibility issues, developers will be more inclined to include accessibility support when creating new XR experiences. Based on the  four W3C/WAI principles (perceivable, operable, understandable,and robust) we believe that the ADA 508 compliance guidelines for web/mobile set a powerful precedent that should be extended to XR.

We're keenly aware that there are recurring accessibility issues that may be common across mulitple platorms. If we begin with the most common challenges, then a new XR accessibility baseline could be established. From there, the possibilities are endless. we've brainstormed about these options as well.

W3C/WAI categories for accessibility issues:
PHYSICAL
SPEECH
VISUAL
AUDITORY
COGNITIVE
NEUROLOGICAL
AGE
TEMPORARY DISABILITY
SITUATIONAL

Here are a few examples of the most common accessibility challenges and possible responses: 

CHALLENGE                                                               COMPLIANCE 

Color-blind user can't distinguish red-green or blue-yellow spectrums   The icon colors go into a high contrast mode or pattern overlay                                                                           helps to distinguish

Vision-impared user may ahve difficulty reading labels, navigating      Function enabled to allow user to enlarge elements when selected in 3D space 

HACKATHON SCOPE- goals, constraints and theory of change for open source solution

APPROACH-based on Design Thinking, inspired by ADA 508 guidelines and W3C/WAI initiative for web/mobile
 Design Thinking was the foundation of our process
