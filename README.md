INTRODUCTION 
(why this project? why now? why this team/why we care?)
 
This team is keenly aware that as XR infiltrates our personal, business, social, and educational lives, there's a swath of the population worldwide that are being left behind- just as they were when web/mobile solutions were first being introduced. Then ADA 508 compliance regulations started getting government and commercial entities to pay attention to the needs of the disabled when creating new web/mobile experiences. We believe that XR create an even bigger divide between those who can easily engage-and those who can't. Therefore we're taking this opportunity toat the RV Hackathon, to shine a spotlight on the challenges of accessibility, create starting point and invite developrs to collaborate  in the future on creating and maintaining an open-source library  that resolves accessibility issues in XR.

PROBLEM

There are 650 million people, 10% of the world's population, with some form of disability. Imagine if you were one of them, with a hearing or vision impairment or limited motor skills trying to engage in an XR experience? What if you were among the 8% of men who have some form of color blindness and could not distinguish colors in the XR space? 

We're exploring ways to close the growing accessibility divide within XR by visualizing an open-source toolkit for developers that helps them integrate support for users with disabilities. Our theory of action is that by taking a cross-platform compliance approach to resolving accesibility issues, developers will be more inclined to include accessibility support when creating new XR experiences. Based on the  four W3C/WAI principles (perceivable, operable, understandable,and robust) we believe that the ADA 508 compliance guidelines for web/mobile set a powerful precedent that should be extended to XR.

We're keenly aware that there are recurring accessibility issues that may be common across mulitple platorms. If we begin with the most common challenges, then a new XR accessibility baseline could be established. From there, the possibilities are endless. we've brainstormed about these options as well using the W3C/WAI categories for accessibility issues to guide discussions.Categories are as follows:PHYSICAL,SPEECH, VISUAL,AUDITORY, COGNITIVE, NEUROLOGICAL, AGE, TEMPORARY DISABILITY, SITUATIONAL.

Here are 2 examples of the common accessibility challenges and ways we might address:possible responses: 
  1. Color-blind user can't distinguish red-green or blue-yellow spectrums. To address that, the icon colors go into a high contrast mode   or pattern overlay helps to distinguish color differences
  2. Vision-impaired user may have difficulty reading labels or navigating XR space. To address that, a function could be enabled to allow user to enlarge elements when selected in 3D space

HACKATHON SCOPE- 

We will explore and experiement ways to close the accessibility divide within XR by visualizing a open-source toolkit for developers that helps them integrate support users with disabilities. 
We envision a strategy that focuses on cross-platform compliance. With this in mind, we'll be selective when choosing 3-4 functions to simulate/protoype.

Our theory of change is that is we shine a spotlight on accessibility issues, demonstrate ways to think about/resolve accessibility issues collaboratively, then we can build momentum for open sources solutions for accessibility. Ultimately we envision users with disabilities wll have more and more opportunities to enter th XR realm of amazing experiences. 

APPROACH-based on Design Thinking, 

We're taking an accelerated approach to the Hackathon project, based on the Design Thinking methodology. We're also leveraging our team's ast experiences and building on the foundation pf accessibility support for web/mobile established by ADA 508 guidelines and the work of W3C/WAI for web/mobile.

We beagn by establishing projectgoals/priorities,roles/responsibilities and prefereed communication channels. WE've primarily used face-to face discussions, our X-able Slack channel and GitHUB to share ideas, give updates and share assets.The following is high level view of our daily activities and outputs                                  
 
DAY 1 
       ACTIVITIES:
       
       -Pitch problem/solution
       
       -Recruit Team 
       
       -Define Scope, constraints & priorities
       
       -Establish Goals
       
       OUTPUTS: Define d approach using collectve work experiences and Design Thinking methods. Also agreed upon the following project            goals/aspirations:
             -Shine a spotlight on expanding digital divide that excludes people of all ages with disabilities from experiencing  XR and                pursuing social, entertainment, educational and career opportunities.
             -Explore/experiment on ways to close the accessibility gap by extending ADA 508 guidelines and principles to common functions              seen across XR platforms/devices. 
             -Prototype elements for an open-source toolkit  that helps developers  add accessible features/functionality into current/                future XR experiences.
             -Demonstrate the use of cross-platform compliant code, supporting for accessibility can transform XR experiences -across                  platforms and devices- for millions of users worldwide.


DAY 2  ACTIVITIES:

       -Brainstorm needs and opportunities
       
       -Research features/functionality gaps and impacts

  BEYOND THE XR ACCESSIBLE BASELINE...
  
  -- Customize voice like avatar: Offer ability to personalize experience with ability to voiceover record own voice as verbal commands  in X experience.
  --Provide ability for user to know/confirm" where am I? with a range of options- via visual, sound, GPS  or vibration cue
  
  --Include dual options for navigating  with clear, consistent iconography color contrast, and voice over options.
  
  --Compensate for face blindness-pulling in his/her contacts/images into experience? for fictional experience embed descriptions of characters/players
  
  -- Allow user AND guide dog with sensor to participate as team in XR 
  
  --Compensate for hearing loss with  visual representation of actions  needed to perform function, emergency signals/ alerts 
  
  -- Give deaf person  ability to sing with gestures/movements/color /vibrations
  
  --For cognitive issues provide memory recall option to" repeat that again" for me- in text and/or visual representation
  
  -- For temporary issues Menu of options/settings   for on/off function that supports a variety of compensatory functions e.g. change brightness after a  an eye operation - then resume normal brightness when healed
