# X-able: Closing the XR Accessibility Divide

INTRODUCTION

          INSERT DAVID'S STORY...


There are 650 million people, 10% of the world's population, with some form of disability. Imagine if you were one of them, with a hearing or vision impairment or limited motor skills trying to engage in an XR experience? What if you were among the 8% of men who have some form of color blindness and could not distinguish colors in the XR space or to use controls? 

We're exploring ways to close the growing accessibility divide within XR by visualizing an open-source toolkit for developers that helps them integrate support for users with disabilities. Our theory of action is that by taking a cross-platform compliance approach to resolving accesibility issues, developers will be more inclined to include accessibility support when creating new XR experiences. Based on the  four W3C/WAI principles (perceivable, operable, understandable,and robust) we believe that the ADA 508 compliance guidelines for web/mobile set a powerful precedent that should be extended to XR.

We're keenly aware that there are recurring accessibility issues that may be common across mulitple platorms. If we begin with the most common challenges, then a new XR accessibility baseline could be established. From there, the possibilities are endless. we've brainstormed about these options as well. 

Here are a few examples of accessibility challenges and possible responses: 

CHALLENGE                                                               COMPLIANCE 

Color-blind user can't distinguish red-green or blue-yellow spectrums   The icon colors go into a high contrast mode or pattern overlay                                                                           helps to distinguish
