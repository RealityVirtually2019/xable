Accessible UI/UX for XR

The goal of this project is to create a UI toolkit/framework for XR developers to make their applications accesible to more users.

One example would be for a colorblind individual to have the icon colors go into a high contrast mode.
Another example is for a user with low vision that would enable them to enlarge elements when selected.
